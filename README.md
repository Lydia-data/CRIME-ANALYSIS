**Understanding Crime Trends and Patterns for Effective Resource Allocation and Crime Prevention**

**Problem Statement:**

The crime dataset, containing records such as Offence Group, Offence Subgroup, Number of Offences, Offence Description, Force Name, and Financial Year/Quarter, provides a comprehensive view of criminal activities over time. However, law enforcement agencies face challenges in identifying trends and predicting future crime occurrences due to the large volume of historical data.
This issue is further complicated by the need to understand how crime patterns evolve across different offence groups and subgroups, and how offences fluctuate throughout the financial years and quarters. Without clear insights into these trends, resource allocation may be inefficient, leading to under-policing in high-crime areas and missed opportunities for crime prevention. Additionally, seasonal fluctuations and specific crime patterns are often overlooked, making it difficult to develop effective crime prevention strategies.

**Key Challenges:**
Identifying Crime Trends: Detecting patterns in crime over time (e.g., quarterly or yearly trends) to understand when offences spike and which offence groups contribute the most.
Resource Allocation: Determining where to focus law enforcement efforts based on historical crime data, particularly during high-crime periods.
Offence Group Analysis: Analyzing how different offence groups and subgroups contribute to total crime and whether certain categories consistently dominate the statistics.
Predictive Crime Analytics: Leveraging historical data to predict potential future trends and help law enforcement agencies proactively mitigate crime.

**Research Objective:**
This project aims to:
Analyze crime patterns by year and quarter to identify seasonal or recurring trends.
Examine offence groups and subgroups to determine which crimes are most frequent and how they evolve over time.
Provide insights for law enforcement agencies to better allocate resources, focusing on high-frequency offence periods.
Support data-driven decision-making for proactive crime prevention by identifying high-risk offence periods and potential future trends.

**Research Questions :**
1. What is the seasonal crime pattern, and how do offences vary across financial quarters?
2. Is there a noticeable pattern in crime rates based on seasonal or quarterly trends?
3. How do different offence groups distribute across financial quarters?
4. What is the overall distribution of offences across the four financial quarters?
5. How does the number of offences change from year to year?
6. What are the most common offence groups?
7. What are the most common specific offence subgroups?
8. How do total offences change across both financial years and quarters?

**Conclusion:**
By answering these research questions and addressing the key challenges, this project seeks to support data-driven law enforcement strategies. The insights gained from analyzing crime patterns, offence distributions, and temporal trends will allow law enforcement agencies to allocate resources more efficiently and prevent crimes proactively. Through this work, we aim to make crime analysis more actionable, leading to safer communities.

**Data preprocessing was performed using Python, involving:**

1. Data deduplication
2. Inconsistency resolution
3. Removal of non-positive values (zero and negative)
4. Data transformation for analysis and visualization compatibility
